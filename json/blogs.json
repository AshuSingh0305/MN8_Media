                "Automatically generated content (or “auto-generated” content) is content that’s automatically generated using a program or code. It is primarily used to manipulate Google’s search results and is considered black-hat SEO.Some auto-generated content does a convincing job of appearing to be written by a human, at least on the surface. But upon closer inspection, auto-generated content can expose itself through jumbled and incoherent language, replacing words with synonyms, and simply scraping search results to rank for certain keywords. While automatically generating content can work to gain search rankings in the short term, it’s not a sustainable strategy. That’s because Google prioritizes content that provides value and a positive user experience; if users visit your website, see robot-written content, and immediately bounce, your rankings will reflect that. And especially for competitive niches where high-quality content is expected from users, auto-generated content is very unlikely to provide even short-term results. Google’s algorithm is constantly improving. Auto-generated content is on their radar, so it’s best not to risk a manual action that could get your website hidden or even banned.",
